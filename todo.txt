==Testing==
- Auth Testing with Playwright

==Grammar Points==
- Write entries for grammar points (probably will take the longest but can be incrementally done)
- Create an ExampleSentence component that can be used to add a sentence to a user's learnedSentences array

==JLPT Quiz==
- Add settings for each of the levels (N5, N4, N3, N2, N1)


==Conjugation Practice==
- Add this implementation

==Final Touches==
- Edit CSS to be responsive on different screens
- Add accessibility properties to HTML elements

==Data Storage==
Frontend:
- Grammar Entries
	- Static data + if it were efficient each point would be its own page
- Default Sentences
	- Static data
	

Backend:
- Users:
	- Email
	- Password
	- SavedSentences
		- JP sentence
		- EN sentence
		- Progress
			- Has to be done to allow custom sentences, might be taxing on database but might be more efficient than storing indexes and queuing the database for them


- SRS: Sentences, like Anki
- Conjugation: User Input on Sentences
- JLPT: Multi-choice
